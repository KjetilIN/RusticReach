# Contributing to RusticReach ðŸ¦€

Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, I appreciate any contribution

## Ways to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

The code is far from finish. If you find a bug, please create an issue first.
Make the title descriptive and use the bug tag for the issue. Then you can start working on solving the issue.
There is nothing bad about creating extra issues. It makes it easier to know what is needed to be done before fixing it. 

### Suggesting Features
- Feel free to submit feature requests through issues
- Explain your use case and how the feature would benefit the project
- Then feel free to implement it

(Smaller issues are more welcome in early development stages)


### Documentation
- Help improve the documentation
- Fix typos or clarify confusing sections
- Add examples and use cases

## PR Request process

I will most likely approve a lot of PR's in early development. 
The PR's should be as small as possible, just to isolate one fix at the time. 

PR's will either get a comment from me, or approved. If I have neither commented the issue or approved it, assume I have not seen it yet :)
