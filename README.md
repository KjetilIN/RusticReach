### Commands

RusticReach uses a simple command system that starts with `/`. When connected to a server, you can navigate between rooms and customize your experience using these commands: 
- `/join <room_name>` lets you enter a public chat room, 
- `/leave` makes you leave the current room
- `/name <new_name>` enables you to change your display name in the current room. 
- `/create -p <ROOM_NAME>` allows you to create a public room
