RusticReach is a self-hosted chat service that in total control of the admin and its users. It enables you to run your own private chat server with extensive customization options. Server administrators have full control over user management, room configurations, and security policies. The YAML-based configuration system allows for easy tweaking of every aspect - from setting welcome messages to defining strict access controls and room limitations.
