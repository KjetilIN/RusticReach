_Repository created for educational purposes only, not for production code_

## Resources and Acknowledgements :
This idea was not orignial, so therefore there is a lot of credits to give out. Both for inspiration and guidance:

  - Link to repo: https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x
- _Rust in Detail_, the blog post of multiple parts, that explains the theory and step by step guide (linked in build-your-own-x repo also)
  - Link to first blog post: https://nbaksalyar.github.io/2015/07/10/writing-chat-in-rust.html#conclusion
- _tsoding_, a youtuber who rewrote his chat application from Go to Rust (Legendary Youtuber, thanks for inspo ðŸ¥³)
